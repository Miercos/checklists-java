Checklists supported: ShoppingList and TodoList

A ShoppingList is a simple list of items that reminds a user what they need to purchase on a shopping trip. It is associated with a single user. ShoppingList is no longer its own class but is an instance of a Checklist. 

A TodoList contains a list of tasks to complete. For TodoLists, the list itself, as well as each item, can optionally have a numerical priority associated with it that distinguishes how important it is compared to other list/items. TodoList items can also have an optional deadline or a suggested range of date/times within which to complete the item. A TodoList is associated with a single user. TodoList is no longer its own class but is an instance of an AdvancedList.
